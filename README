The distinct combinatorial types for each equivalence class of (0,1,a)-polytopes were found with the appropriately adjusted code in find.sage. They have been stored by their vertices-in-facet descriptions according to number of vertices. The folders correspond to the following a values.

012_1polys: a = 2.1
012_4polys: a = 2.4
012_5polys: a = 2.5
012_7polys: a = 2.7
012polys:   a = 2
013_1polys: a = 3.1
013_2polys: a = 3.2
013polys:   a = 3
014polys:   a = 4
irr1:		a = (1/18*sqrt(23)*sqrt(3)+1/2)^(1/3)+1/3/(1/18*sqrt(23)*sqrt(3)+1/2)^(1/3)+1
irr2:		a = 1/2*sqrt(5) + 3/2
irr3:		a = (1/18*sqrt(31)*sqrt(3)+47/54)^(1/3)+7/9/(1/18*sqrt(31)*sqrt(3)+47/54)^(1/3)+4/3
irr4:		a = sqrt(2)+2
